#This program converts kilometers to miles.
#prompt the user for the number of kilometers 
#and then print out the number of miles.

#1. Input the distance in kilometers (call it km)
distance = input("Enter the distance in kilometer: ")
km = float(distance)
#2. Calculate the distance in miles as 0.621371*km
miles = miles = 0.621371*km
#3. Output miles
print("The miles are", miles)
